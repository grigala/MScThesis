First, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Marcel L{\"u}thi for his continuous support and guidance over the course of this thesis. Further, I would like to thank Professor Thomas Vetter for giving me the opportunity to work in the Graphics and Vision Research Group.  I also thank Dr. Andreas-Morel Foster for his help and valuable input, as well as, PhD students Patrick Kahr, Dana Rahbani and Dennis Madsen for their involvement in this project. Last but not least, I would like to thank my friends (especially those who proofread my work) and family for their support.
